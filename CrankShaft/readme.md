# CrankShaft Folder
The CrankShaft folder is where all of your files for this set of templates, custom modules, coded files should go.
* Templates go in the appropriate sub-folder of `/templates`
* Custom Modules go in `/modules`
  * Module linked assets like javascript and css files can go in the dependencies folder to keep things clean.
* Coded files if they are templates or template partials go in `/templates`. Otherwise they go in `/code` in the appropriate folder in there.
