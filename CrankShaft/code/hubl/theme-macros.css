/**
 * * theme-macros.css 
 * * This file contains macros you can use to build out your site more efficiently with. None of the Macros included are mandatory, macros required for CrankShaft are stored in the cs folder files. Macros provided here are optional helpers you can use. Since they are only handled server side there isn't really a reason to remove ones you don't use.
 * TODO: Add file location to this comment, to make it easy to find when inspecting on front end.
