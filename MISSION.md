# CrankShaft's mission
CrankShaft's primary mission is to enable developers to quickly build high quality HubSpot sites taking advantage of HubSpot best practices and special features. 
>We are building the Crankshaft to the whole HubSpot Flywheel

## Secondary Goals
* Be the go to starting point for HubSpot CMS developers.
* Encourage development best practices.
* Designed to be site agnostic. (custom modules and features should not be site specific. It's okay to add optional theming functionality however)
* Do force a specific grid, but include one optionally.
* Make it easier to build semantic and a11y friendly HubSpot sites.
* Be fully compatible with both HubSpot Drag n Drop templates AND Coded templates.
* Support IE 11, and the latest 2 versions of all major evergreen browsers
* Avoid breaking HubSpot injected UI components like forms.
* Javascript written can be vanilla or jQuery (latest HubSpot allowed version). Any other Libraries can be loaded when appropriate within custom modules as needed, but vanilla and jQuery will be included. At a later date we may refactor and go mostly vanilla. The intent is to avoid locking the framework into a technology it is too difficult to break away from.
