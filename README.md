This framework is loosely based upon the HubSpot COS Boilerplate to ensure HubSpot compatibility and because it was a good starting point. Our goal however is to build a framework for building websites on HubSpot that enables faster development, higher quality and better performance. 

We are building the Crankshaft to the whole HubSpot Flywheel - hense the name.

We're in the early stages. Figuring things out, contribute how you can/want to. Feel free to create issues and we'll talk some things through. Feel free to add code.

We're in the early stage of start building/adding stuff and we'll figure things out a bit as we go.
This puppy's gonna have 4WD.

If you'd like an invite to contribute to this Repo, you can contact @jonmclaren on the HubSpot Developer Slack. or feel free to submit a pull request. If I can make it more open in someway so users can make themselves contributors I will do that.
